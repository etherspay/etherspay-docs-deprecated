# Payments

Payments is the most basic type of service Etherspay offers.



It allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency payments quickly and securely. The service is available 24/7 and can be accessed from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. With Etherspay Payments, users can easily manage their cryptocurrency transactions and keep track of their balances in real-time on the Dashboard.



#### Payment methods

Users can add or customize payment methods in the ‘Payments and networks’ settings in the Dashboard.

Etherspay supports every single token following the ERC20 token standard. This means users can easily send and receive payments using any ERC20 token, such as USDT, DAI, or LINK.

If you don’t find the token you are looking for, you can always import it using the token contract address.

#### Supported networks

Etherspay supports most of the EVM blockchains.

·        Ethereum

·        Binance Smart Chain

·        Polygon

·        Testnets



#### Payment fees

Etherspay charges a small fee for each transaction. The fee amount depends on the network congestion and the amount of gas required for the transaction. Users can view the estimated fee before confirming the transaction on the payment confirmation screen.

In addition to the transaction fee, users may also be charged a network fee by the blockchain network being used. This fee is not collected by Etherspay and is paid directly to the network.

Service fees are also included!



#### Recurring payments

Please read \[Billing] for information about recurring payments using Web3.

#### Collecting payments

Etherspay also provides merchants with the ability to easily collect cryptocurrency payments from their customers. Merchants can generate payment requests and invoices, which include the amount owed and the corresponding cryptocurrency address for payment. These payment requests can be sent directly to customers via email or other messaging platforms. Once the payment is received, the merchant can view the transaction details and confirm the payment on the Dashboard.

Using the NPM package \`etherspay\`, developers can easily integrate Etherspay Payments into their applications. The package provides a simple API for sending and receiving payments, as well as managing user account balances and transaction history.

Using our API, developers can build custom integrations that allow their applications to interact with Etherspay Payments programmatically. The API provides endpoints for creating and managing user accounts, sending and receiving payments, and querying transaction history. Developers can use the API to build custom payment flows and integrate Etherspay Payments into their existing applications. To get started with the API, visit our developer documentation at\
