# Token creation

At Etherspay, you have the ability to issue your own crypto tokens.

This means that you can create a unique token with its own name, symbol, and supply. You can also specify the rules for how the token can be transferred and who can hold it. This feature allows you to develop your own ecosystem of value and reward within the Etherspay platform.

These tokens can be managed within the Etherspay Dashboard.

⚠️ Every token must have the ERC20 token standard

#### Networks

When creating a token, you have the option to choose which network you want it to be on. Etherspay currently supports the Ethereum network, BSC, Polygon and some testnets but we will be adding support for other networks in the future. Keep in mind that each network has its own unique features and capabilities, so choose the one that best fits your token's needs.
