# Token lending

Etherspay offers users the opportunity to lend tokens on its platform by utilizing Aave flash loans.

&#x20;

These flash loans enable borrowers to access funds from the Aave liquidity pool without the need for collateral. As a result, users can borrow funds for a short period, execute their desired transactions, and then repay the borrowed amount along with the fees. By utilizing these flash loans, users can lend tokens on the Etherspay platform and earn interest on their idle assets in a simple and convenient manner.

&#x20;

#### Integration

To execute flash loans via our platform, developers can integrate with our libraries, smart contracts, or API. Our API provides a simple interface for developers to execute flash loans programmatically. Our libraries and smart contracts provide the necessary infrastructure for executing flash loans, allowing developers to integrate Etherspay flash loans into their existing applications.



#### Pricing

Etherspay charges a small service fee for using flash loans on our platform. This fee covers the costs of maintaining and developing our platform, as well as providing customer support. The exact fee amount may vary depending on the size and duration of the flash loan. Users can view the estimated fee before executing the flash loan on the confirmation screen.
