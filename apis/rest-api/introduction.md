# Introduction

The Etherspay API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_State\_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs and returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use testnet payment networks like Rinkeby, which doesn't affect your real balance.

Users will need to authenticate themselves using an API Key, this key can be found in the Developers page on your project dashboard.
